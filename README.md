# ScavCaseCraftingPatch
Fixes a minor bug in the Scav case where you can start a second free craft without payment. Tracked by https://github.com/sp-tarkov/server/issues/401 and is currently marked as "not planned" since it's probably a bug in live, but it was really bothering me so I made a patch for it.

It's probably unlikely for most people playing SPT to run into this, but if you have something like [ODT Softcore](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/998-softcore-proper-singleplayer-experience-for-spt/)â€‹ you're going to be doing a lot of crafting very quickly and may reach max crafting more often than not.
