# ScavCaseCraftingPatch
Fixes a minor bug in the Scav case where you can start a second free craft without payment. Tracked by https://github.com/sp-tarkov/server/issues/401 and is currently marked as "not planned", but it was really bothering me.

This is probably unlikely for most people playing SPT, but if you have something like ODT Softcore you're going to be doing a lot of crafting very quickly and may reach max crafting more often than not.
